# Building and deploying a Cloud Native app

## Newcomers

So maybe you have heard the following buzzwords,
but really do not understand what they mean,
what they are about,
and how they fit together:

- Cloud Native
- Twelve Factor
- Containers, Container Orchestration

If that is you,
this workshop is for you.

You will be introduced to the reasons and basic concepts you will need
to understand how to successfully
*build, deploy and operate* an application on a modern *orchestrated*
platform.

Along the way you will build and deploy a basic web application to a
modern container orchestrated platform.

## Non-newcomers

If you are already well versed on the Cloud Native fundamental practices
and guidelines,
perhaps the associated slideware and video content might be good
refreshers for you.

If you are already familiar with Java, Spring, Spring Boot and/or
Kubernetes,
you might find the exercises and accompanying slideware and video
lecture a good way to reinforce your understanding of how the tools
fit with the Cloud Native landscape,
and why you use them.

## Tools

If you are coming to this workshop to learn how to use Spring or
Spring Boot to solve X,
or how to use Kubernetes to solve Y,
well,
*this workshop is not for you*.

You will be better served by the product specific tracks in the
[Tanzu Developer Center](https://tanzu.vmware.com/developer/),
or [KubeAcademy](https://kube.academy/).

## Learning outcomes

After completing the workshop,
you will be able to:

-   Deploy a blocking web application to a modern orchestrated platform.

-   Explain the benefits of adopting cloud native principles and
    practices.

-   Explain some of the challenges of deploying applications in a
    cloud native architecture

## House keeping

### Exercises

To run the workshop,
you need a modern browser,
preferably with custom shortcut plugins (like `Vimium`) turned off.

That is it.

The workshop will provide a simulated "local" development environment
that runs on a public Cloud that you can access over the internet.

You are also provided a slice of a Kubernetes cluster as your
application deployment platform.

Follow the instructions precisely,
you can use the action links to handle the navigation for you.

### Lectures

The lectures are a virtual instructor narrative using the
slideware to present key Cloud Native foundational concepts.

You can access the lectures in the *Lecture* dashboard.
It supplies a playlists in order as specified in this intro,
as well as the exercises.

For best learning experience,
we recommend you follow the sequence as prescribed in the
instructions.

### Slideware

The slides are cloud provided Google slides.
If you follow the links,
a separate browser tab will be opened with a presenter's view.
You can view the lecture speaker transcript by viewing the
speaker notes.
