Now that you have finished all the exercises,
and watched all the accompanying content,
hopefully you realize there is a lot more stories to tell about Cloud
Native practices,
and more to it than deployment.

There is a lot of complexity,
and a lot of moving parts to consider for merely getting a trivial
web application deployed to a "modern" platform.

And we did not cover many more important issues such as security,
or hardening your application for production.

Watch for later workshops that will tackle problems such as:

-   How to handle external configuration
-   How to use Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery practices
-   How to operate your application in production, such as monitoring,
    scaling, upgrading and handling or mitigating failures
-   How to handle security
-   How to design and implement distributed applications,
    along with the Cloud Native and Microservice patterns the solve
    certain types of problems when introducing network boundaries
-   What to do when the Blocking Web application architecture style
    falls short

All the best,
and hope to see you later!
