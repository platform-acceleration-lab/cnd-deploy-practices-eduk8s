# Containerizing an App

This lab will walk you through how to containerize an application.
You will use a Gradle task provided by Spring Boot Plugin to
generate container image.
Behind the scenes,
the Gradle task uses [Buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io/) to generate
the image.

Once you have built your container image, you will test it using the
locally installed Docker container runtime.

# Learning Outcomes

After completing the lab, you will be able to:

-   Describe how to generate a runnable container image for your
    application

-   Explain how to publish an image to a container registry

# Getting started

Review the following slides:

```dashboard:create-dashboard
name: Containerize
url: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/184YWy6tmtSQ8-bXLw3wdZYcHQEkgW3-cZ3Y7Dqq3rMo/present?slide=id.gc70c0249b7_0_168
```

or the accompanying introduction video:

```dashboard:create-dashboard
name: Containerize
url: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1js7Pph8sx2G7w937PDhH_Js1ZZ93Ubp3/preview
```

Make sure you are in your `~/exercises/pal-tracker` directory now in
both of your terminal windows,
and clear both:

```terminal:execute-all
command: cd ~/exercises/pal-tracker
```

```terminal:clear-all
```

# Use Buildpacks to containerize your app

To generate container images, you will be using a Gradle task.

1.  From the root of your application, use the `bootBuildImage` task to
    generate a runnable container image for your application.
    (It might take about a minute or so for the task to finish.)

    ```terminal:execute
    command: ./gradlew bootBuildImage
    session: 1
    ```

1.  Once the `bootBuildImage` task finishes, verify that an image was
    generated and is listed in your locally available Docker images.
    Run the following command and look for an image named `pal-tracker`.

    ```terminal:execute
    command: docker images
    session: 1
    ```

1.  Run your image using `docker` and expose port 8080 where your
    application is listening.

    ```terminal:execute
    command: docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 pal-tracker
    session: 1
    ```

1.  In the console output, you should see Spring Boot starting up your
    application.
    Once it is running,
    from a separate terminal window execute a request:

    ```terminal:execute
    command: curl -v http://localhost:8080
    session: 2
    ```

    You should see your `hello` message.

1.  Terminate the application:

    ```terminal:execute
    command: <ctrl+c>
    session: 1
    ```

# Container registry

Next you will publish your image to a container registry where
your container orchestrated platform can pull to run in a CaaS or PaaS
environment.

For this lab, you will use a container registry provided to you,
but you could (in theory) use any container registry.

Examples of other container registries are
[Harbor](https://goharbor.io/),
[Github Container Registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/guides/about-github-container-registry),
[Amazon Elastic Container Registry](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/),
[Google Container Registry](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry),
and
[Docker Hub](https://docker.io).
Ideally you should use a private registry unless you are building open
source projects.

You do not need to explicitly login to the container registry provided
to you.
Your docker client is already set to a private container registry
provided in your lab environment.

# Publish your image

You are now ready to publish your image to your container registry.

1.  Start by tagging your image with your container registry,
    and a version.

    ```terminal:execute
    command: docker tag pal-tracker {{ registry_host }}/pal-tracker:v0
    session: 1
    ```

1.  Push your image to your container registry:

    ```terminal:execute
    command: docker push {{ registry_host }}/pal-tracker:v0
    session: 1
    ```

# Check your exercise

Run a smoke test using the
`cloudNativeDeveloperK8sContainerizingAnApp` gradle task from within the
existing `smoke-tests` project directory.
It requires you to provide the name of your container registry.

1.  Navigate to the `~/exercises/smoke-tests` directory in
    terminal 2:

    ```terminal:execute
    command: cd ~/exercises/smoke-tests
    session: 2
    ```

1.  Run the smoke-tests command in terminal 2:

    ```terminal:execute
    command: ./gradlew cloudNativeDeveloperK8sContainerizingAnApp -Prepository={{ registry_host }}/pal-tracker
    session: 2
    ```
